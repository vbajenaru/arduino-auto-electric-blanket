# arduino-musical-instrument

Upload the .ino file to an Arduino, with the proper wiring, to produce this musical instrument!

See the following video for a demonstration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4f-OPOBNEc

The instrument uses the following components:
- 1 speaker
- 2 buttons to activate different sounds
- 2 potentiometers to vary pitch/rhythm
- 1 button to change between 3 different sound modes
- 1 RGB light for the light show
- 1 red light and 1 one yellow light for additional high-end light effects

I have not made wire diagrams, but it may be possible to track the wire locations with this picture if you'd like to recreate it:
