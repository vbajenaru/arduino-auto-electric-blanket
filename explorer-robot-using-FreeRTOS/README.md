# explorer-robot-using-FreeRTOS

Upload the explorer_robot.ino file to an Arduino, with the proper wiring, to produce this explorer robot!

Also see the following video for an overview of the components and workings: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4f-OPOBNEc

I have not made wire diagrams, but it may be possible to track the wire locations with this picture if you'd like to recreate it:
